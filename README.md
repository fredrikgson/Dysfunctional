### About the game
This is a short little game that I developed in just over a week for the **Godot Wild Jam 24**. I also created the graphics and music for this project. The game jam theme was "family", and as the name suggests, using the Godot game engine was a requirement.

A total of 70 entries were submitted to the game jam, and Dysfunctional placed **3rd** overall! In addition, the game was ranked the 2nd most fun of all entries, having the 2nd best controls, and did quite well in some other categories too. The results can be seen here: https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-24-our-2-year/rate/736773
